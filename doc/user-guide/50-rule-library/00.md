# Rule Library

This section provides some generic, reusable rules that may prove useful. Adjust
them to suit your needs.

In the examples, we have properly formatted any JSON in the source. In the
absence of the slacker rule, this would appear in Slack as unreadable symbol
soup. The chunky kind. With carrots.

!!! note
    Some of the rules in the library may have overlapping scope. Bear in mind
    that the order of rules is significant, with the first matching rule being
    the only one that is applied. More specific rules should precede less
    specific ones.
