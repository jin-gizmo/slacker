**Slacker** (aka *JinSlacker*) sends messages from AWS services to Slack. It
supports dynamic time-of-day and content based filtering, rewriting
and routing of messages.

**Slacker** has been used extensively in a large, business critical data warehouse /
data lake environment.

    **Slacker** was developed at [Origin Energy](https://www.originenergy.com.au) as part of the
    *Jindabyne* initiative. While not part of our core IP, it proved valuable
    internally, and we're sharing it in the hope it's useful to others.
